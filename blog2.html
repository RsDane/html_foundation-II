    <h3>What is JavaScript?</h3>
      <p><strong>JavaScript</strong> often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language and core technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. 99% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for wepage behavior, often incorporating third-party libraries. All major web browser have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on user's devices.</p>

      <p><strong>JavaScript</strong> is a high-level, often just-in time complied language that conforms to the ECMAScript standard. It has dynamic typing, prototype-base object-orientation, and first-class function. It is multi paragtigm, supporting event driven, function, and imperative programming styles. It has application proggramming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expression, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM)</p>

      <p>The <strong>ECMAScript standard</strong>does not include any input/output (I/O), such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities. In practice, the web browser or other runtime system provides JavaScript APIs for I/O.</p>

      <p>JavaScript engines were originally used only in web browsers, but are now core components of some 
        servers and a variety of applications. The most popular runtime system for this usage is Node.js</p>
      <p>Although Java and JavaScript are similar in name, syntax, and respective standard libraries, the two 
        languages are distinct and differ greatly in design.</p>

    <h3>Website Client-side Usage</h3>
        
    <p>JavaScript is the dominant client-side scripting language of the Web, with 99% of all websites using it for this purpose. [10] Script are embedded in or included from HTML documents and interact with the DOM.</p>

    <p>All major web browser have a built-in JavaScript engine that executes the code the  user's device.</p>

    <p>Example of Scripted Behavior</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Loading new web page content without reloading the page, via Ajax or a WebSocket. For 
            example, users of social media can send and receive messages without leaving the current page.</li>
          <li>Web page animations, such as fading objects in and out, resizing, and moving them.</li>
          <li>Playing browser games</li>
          <li>Controlling the playback of streaming media.
          </li>
          <li>Generating pop-up ads or alert boxes.</li>
          <li>Validating input values of a web form before the data is sent to a web server.</li>
          <li>Logging data about the user's behavior then sending it to a server. The website owner can use this data for analytics, ad tracking, and personalization.</li>
          <li>Redirecting a user to another page.
          </li>
          <li>Storing and retrieving data on the user's device, via the storage or IndexedDB standards.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Web Libraries and Frameworks</h3>

        <p><strong>React</strong>(also known as React.js or ReactJS) is a free open-source front-end JavaScript library for building user interfaces based on  components. It is maintained by Meta (Formerly Facebook) and a community of individual developers and companies.</p>

        <h3>Angular</h3>

        <p><strong>Angular</strong>(also referred to as "Angular 2+") is a <strong>TypeScript-base,</strong> free and open-source single-page web application framwork led by the angular Team at Google and by a community of individual and corporation. Angular is a complete rewrites from the same team built AngularJS.</p>

        <h3>JQuery</h3>

      <p>In 2012, <strong>jQuery</strong> was by far the most popular client-side library, used by over 75% of websites. While still 
        in widespread use, its popularity has been surpassed by newer libraries and frameworks.</p>

        <h3>Vanilla JS</h3>

        <p>The framework-like moniker <strong>"Vanilla JS"</strong> is term that has been coined for websites not using any libraries 
          or frameworks at all, instead relying entirely on standard JavaScript functionality</p>
